This project was started to make tools that help to calculate CNC settings.

The source files so far only contain one module, with one function in it.

Module: cnc.calc
Function: cnc_calc(i_data)

This functions returns a tuple containing a key (str) and a value (float).

The :i_data parameter is necessary, and should be modified to the data available. The parameter which one wishes to 
have calculated, should be left with the value 0.

Data structure:
  i_data = {
        "rpm": 0, #ex. 15000 - 18000
        "cl_mm": 0.0, #cut load mm, ex. 0.38
        "fr_mmin": 0.0, #feed rate mm/min, ex. 80
        "n_teeth": 0, #no of teeth, ex. 1 for single flute
        "cut_depth": 1.0    #cut-depth in times of bit diameter
                            #reduces chip if bigger than 1.0
        }
